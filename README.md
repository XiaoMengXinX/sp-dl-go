# Notice

- You need to put a [CDM](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/408031-Dumping-Your-own-L3-CDM-with-Android-Studio) in the `./cdm` directory for mp4 decryption.

- Get your `sp_dc` cookie value from somewhere and enter it to the terminal at your first run.

- OGG decryption may not always work because the platform occasionally updates the decryption token or something, which is not easy to obtain.
